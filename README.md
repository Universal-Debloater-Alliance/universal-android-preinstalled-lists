# universal-android-preinstalled-lists
The set of all known built-in ("pre-installed") Android packages. Will be used primarily by [UAD-NG](https://github.com/Universal-Debloater-Alliance/universal-android-debloater-next-generation).

## Name
Rationale:
- "Universal" (actually global) emphasizes the fact that it comprises packages from a wide gamut of devices.
- "Android" is necessary to disambiguate from a general pack database.
- "Pre-installed" because not everything is bloat
- "Lists" in plural, because it'll be split in multiple files. And unordered-lists are a thing

If you have suggestions for a better name, please let us know soon! It's better to rename now than later.

## Why

This repo was created in response to [this](https://github.com/Universal-Debloater-Alliance/universal-android-debloater-next-generation/discussions/646), and because we (the org members) have "voted" (not formally) and agreed that it had to be done.

Among the reasons why the lists must be split from the app repo are:
- Better issue/PR management and organization
- Versioning: more predictable "API" for 3rd-party consumers (such as [Canta](https://github.com/samolego/Canta/blob/135bda40c581eeb1d365d44c902ac1688834071a/README.md?plain=1#L14))
- Multi-list support
